# Starlink Ghana Monitor

A Ghana-focused extension and calculator built on [Dishylink](https://github.com/DaveyHert/dishylink), by DaveyHert, under its MIT license.

## Phone companion and history recovery (v1.6.0)

Open [the installable mobile dashboard](https://starlink-ghana.vercel.app/live/) on your iPhone or any browser. Use Safari's Share → Add to Home Screen to install as a PWA. The companion now has Overview, Costs, Devices and Connection tabs. No sign-in: from the **Chrome extension → Overview → Phone companion**, select **Connect my phone**, then open the private pairing link on your phone. Summary usage, energy and cedi cost estimates sync approximately every ten minutes while Chrome is running. When the laptop is off, the phone accurately shows the last saved snapshot instead of claiming live connectivity.

Pairing is protected by separate long random read/write tokens. Normal phone snapshots upload aggregated metrics, including opted-in device display names but not Starlink sign-in cookies or MAC addresses. Phone cloud storage is an isolated table in the owner's existing free PostgreSQL project.

**History protection added in v1.6.0:** The Chrome extension now also maintains a rolling, independent `chrome.storage.local` copy of recent genuine minute measurements while Chrome runs; it can recover from an IndexedDB-only reset, but not an entire Chrome-profile loss. The new **History vault** in Overview provides an optional off-device Supabase minute archive, independently protected with the existing private pairing capability. Backups are append-only and only finalized minutes are uploaded; restoring merges missing minutes without overwriting current history. A paired phone can download a portable archive JSON. Enable the vault explicitly because detailed minute readings can reveal household activity. The old Oct 8 CSV is an aggregate, not an invented minute-level record. [Release details](docs/ghana-release-notes.md). Full setup, limitations, revocation and component reference notes: [Phone sync documentation](docs/phone-sync/README.md).

## What Ghana Monitor adds

- Electricity in cedis, PURC residential tiers, household usage and an editable custom rate.
- Plan allocation plus electricity, effective cost per recorded GB, honest coverage and correct calendar periods.
- Month overview, usage and spending targets, forecasts, device cost shares, device search/sorting and equal bill splitting.
- Your own mobile-bundle comparison, a night-time power scenario and CSV exports.
- Version checking and a repeatable extension release workflow.

The public website is a calculator and optional local-collector viewer. It cannot directly read your dish or the extension's private history. For live readings, open the Chrome extension on a computer connected to the Starlink LAN. Keep Chrome running to record. The extension records primarily to local IndexedDB, mirrors recent data in a separate local storage area and supports optional off-device archive if explicitly enabled. Its manual version check contacts the public website without sharing readings or account details.

## Install or update

Download the ZIP above, unzip it, and load the folder using Chrome's Developer mode at `chrome://extensions`. Chrome 144+ is required. To update an existing installation, close its dashboard, **replace the files in the same loaded folder**, press **Reload** on the existing extension card, and reopen it. Keep the same folder and extension ID; do not remove the extension, as that can erase history. Unpacked installations do not update automatically. Future shared-app changes require a package version bump to show a newer version in the in-app check.

## Cost methodology

Calendar-month views use the recorder computer's timezone, normally Africa/Accra in Ghana. Recorded kWh and GB never fill missing hours. Full-month forecasts use sampled averages only after 24 recorded hours; otherwise electricity uses the selected model and powered hours. Effective cedis/GB requires a plan fee, positive traffic and >=80% coverage. Device allocations split the full-month forecast by router traffic shares, not measured electrical draw. Starlink billing usage is a separate authoritative source and its billing cycle may differ.

PURC Q4 rates effective 1 October 2026: lifeline GHS 0.899315/kWh, residential up to 300 kWh GHS 2.037509/kWh, above 300 kWh GHS 2.692235/kWh. [Official schedule, page 3](https://www.purc.com.gh/attachment/545028-20260924090934.pdf). Lifeline requires whole-household usage <=30 kWh. Fixed charges, levies and separate router/mesh power are excluded. Subscription is fixed: using more GB changes effective cost, not the bill itself.

## Development

```sh
npm ci
npm run dev:extension
npm run typecheck
npm run typecheck:extension
npm test -- --project node
npm run zip:extension
cd landing
npm ci
npm run build
```

An open-source Starlink desktop app for macOS, Windows and browsers to monitor
the performance and health of your Starlink.

It reads your dish and router directly over your local network, so it keeps
working during an outage — which is exactly when you want to see what happened.
No account, no cloud, no telemetry: everything it records is written to your own
machine and stays there. Connecting a Starlink account is optional. It adds
your plan and billing figures and enables supported router controls such as
pausing connected devices. Your session remains stored locally and is sent
only to Starlink.

Apple silicon (M1 and later) or `x64` for Intel.

## Features

### What it shows

- **Stat tiles**: live downlink and uplink, pop-ping latency, power draw in watts,
  60-second ping-success rate and sky-obstruction fraction. Each carries a
  sparkline and opens into a detail panel.
- **Throughput chart**: download and upload across 15m, 1h and 6h windows on the
  dashboard, or by day, week and month from recorded history rather than only what
  the current tab has seen.
- **Latency chart**: bucketed by _max_, so spikes survive downsampling instead of
  averaging away. Outages are drawn as red bands.
- **Energy and power chart**: what the dish actually draws over time, with kWh
  totals by day, week and month, and honest gaps wherever recording stopped.
- **Sky obstruction map**: the dish's 123×123 SNR grid drawn as a polar sky dome,
  with obstructed cells escalating through a status palette.
- **Obstruction time-lapse**: scrub back through hourly snapshots of the sky
  survey, with LIVE as the last stop.
- **Sky view**: a full-viewport scene of the dome, your dish, and the satellite
  constellation passing overhead. Click any satellite for its pass details.
- **Alignment dials**: rotation and tilt against the desired azimuth and elevation
  band, ported from the dish's own web app.
- **Data usage**: self-measured download and upload volume by day, week and month,
  plus **per-device usage** for the billing month taken from the router's own
  per-client counters. Name your devices and see vendor, device type and last-seen
  times.
- **Network**: router radio temperatures, the client list, per-client throughput
  and the router's own event log.
- **Event logs**: outages, thermal events, and a terminal panel covering firmware,
  GPS, alignment, mesh routers and alerts.
- **Speed test and alerts**: on-demand speed tests, alerts graded by severity with
  an in-app bell, and light, dark or system instrument themes.
- **Cloud account tab** (optional, opt-in): your Starlink plan, billing cycles and
  authoritative monthly data usage, plus the authenticated controls your router
  supports.

### What it controls

Monitoring is only half of it. Most settings write to the dish or router over
the same LAN API; controls that current firmware rejects locally are identified
below as requiring an optional Starlink account connection:

- **Snow melt**: automatic, always on, or off.
- **Sleep schedule**: power the dish down for a set number of hours each day.
- **Software updates**: pick the reboot window, or defer updates for 3 days.
- **Maintenance**: reboot the dish, reset the learned obstruction map, and
  stow/unstow motorized kits.
- **Router**: SSIDs and their bands, mesh node trust, firmware and country, and
  a router reboot.
- **Router address and subnet**: point Dishylink at a router that isn't on the
  default address, and change the address range the router hands out. Changing the
  subnet needs a connected account.
- **Custom DNS**: point the router at your own resolvers.
- **Bypass mode**: put the router into bridge mode for your own networking gear.
- **Connected devices**: pause or unpause another device while it is connected.
  Available in the desktop app and web development harness, this control requires
  an optional Starlink account sign-in: Dishylink reads the router configuration
  locally, prepares the smallest accepted client update on the trusted host, and
  sends it only to Starlink's authenticated device endpoint. The device running
  Dishylink cannot pause itself, which is what **Your device on this network** in
  app settings pins down. The browser extension does not expose this control
  because ordinary desktop extensions cannot reliably read the host computer's LAN
  IP or MAC address. Although the extension can send the update, it cannot prove
  which router client is itself and therefore cannot safely prevent self-pausing.
- **Copy debug data**: diagnostics + status + config as JSON, for bug reports.

Content filtering is deliberately _not_ exposed: a bad write there can take the
WiFi down until a physical reset.

### Network rules

Meter any device on your network and pause it automatically when it goes over.

- **Three kinds of limit**: a data allowance, a schedule that pauses by the clock,
  or a countdown that runs for a set stretch of time.
- **One device or a group**: meter a device on its own, or group several together.
  A group can either pool its allowance, so members spend from one shared budget
  and run out together, or give each member the full allowance to spend
  independently.
- **One list for everything**: every rule on the network appears in one place,
  whether you wrote it there or from a device's own card, each showing how much of
  its limit is left.
- Rules use the same account-connected pausing described above, including the
  protection that stops Dishylink pausing the device it is running on.

## Three ways to run it in dev

Dishylink ships as three independent products from one codebase. To run any of
them from source:

```bash
npm install

npm run dev              # web harness on localhost:5173
npm run dev:electron     # desktop app on Mac and Linux
npm run dev:electron:win # desktop app on Windows
npm run dev:extension    # browser extension, loaded unpacked from .output/ (WXT)
```

Windows needs `dev:electron:win` rather than `dev:electron`: it sets the
environment variable through `cross-env` and skips the icon generation step,
neither of which works from a Windows shell.

All three read the real hardware, so you have to be on the Starlink LAN for
anything to appear. Tests and typechecks run anywhere.

They don't talk to each other or share a runtime: each independently polls the
dish/router and records its own history. Packaging:

```bash
npm run pack:mac        # signed Mac build
npm run pack:win        # Windows build
npm run build:extension # Chromium extension bundle
npm run build:extension:firefox
npm run build:extension:edge
docker compose up --build   # browser dashboard + recorder, this machine only
```

### Docker (browser)

Packages the web dashboard and the history recorder in one container. The
image is built **only for the CPU of the machine you clone and build on** —
amd64 on an x86 box, arm64 on Apple Silicon or a 64-bit Raspberry Pi. Compose
does not cross-build. Open `http://localhost:8080`. The **host running Docker
must be on the Starlink LAN** — the dish (`192.168.100.1`) and router
(`192.168.1.1`) are reached through the host, not from inside Compose. Docker
Desktop has no real `--network host`; do not set it.

```bash
docker compose up --build
```

A Raspberry Pi 4/5 needs the 64-bit OS and enough RAM for the Vite build
(4 GB is comfortable; 2 GB often OOMs).

Recordings, and a pasted starlink.com session, persist in the `historian-data`
volume — a session survives a restart with no extra mount needed. If
`com.dishylink.historian` is already running under launchd, stop it first —
two recorders double the router's 200 ms client poll.

Optional, in `compose.yaml`:

- `HOST_LAN_IP` / `HOST_MAC` — the host's LAN address, so "This device" and
  pause-self-protect still work through Docker Desktop's port publish.

Cloud session writes stay localhost-only. Opening the dashboard via the host's
LAN IP from a phone still shows live data and history.

Useful while working on it:

```bash
npm run historian       # standalone energy collector, serving /api/energy
npm run test:watch      # vitest in watch mode
npm run lint:fix        # eslint with --fix
```

A fresh desktop build opens with no history by design: it fills up as it runs.

### Desktop app (Mac, Windows)

- Lives in the tray / menu bar and **keeps recording after its window is
  closed**; it quits only from the tray's Quit.
- **Live throughput readout** — ↓/↑ rates in the macOS menu bar, or a draggable
  always-on-top pill on Windows. Whichever surface, the open window feeds it
  when there is one and the recorder takes over when there isn't, so the dish is
  never polled twice.
- **Start at Login**, launching hidden, so collection covers the outages that
  happen while nobody is looking.
- Native OS notifications for alerts when the window isn't in front, throttled
  so a flapping link can't spam.
- Auto-updates, and remembers its window position across runs and displays.

### Browser extension (Chrome, Edge, Firefox)

Install it from the
[Chrome Web Store](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/dishylink/pljgamnkfokhbchiiommnblkjffffnna),
[Edge Add-ons](https://microsoftedge.microsoft.com/addons/detail/pknccegejhlgmeiojalenedmkbcaimdo)
or [Firefox Add-ons](https://addons.mozilla.org/addon/dishylink/).

- The toolbar icon opens the dashboard as a chromeless window (default) or an
  ordinary tab — never a cramped toolbar popup.
- **Toolbar badge** — the number of alerts firing right now, tinted by the worst
  one's severity, so it reads the same outside the app as the bell does inside.
- **Recording** — its own history store in IndexedDB, filled by a 30s
  `chrome.alarms` tick that survives service-worker teardown, with honest
  coverage gaps for stretches when the browser was closed.
- Chrome 144+ — below that a Local Network Access bug makes the worker silently
  collect nothing.

Dev workflow:

```bash
npm test                # vitest
npm run typecheck       # tsc -b
npm run lint            # eslint
```

Diagnostics:

```bash
node scripts/debug-decode.mjs <captured-body.bin>   # decode a captured response
node scripts/debug-browser.mjs                      # probe fetch path in headless Chrome
```

## How it talks to the dish and router

The dish serves its API at `192.168.100.1` on two ports; the router answers
a matching API on its own LAN address:

| Port | Protocol                | Notes                               |
| ---- | ----------------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| 9200 | native gRPC (HTTP/2)    | used by `grpcurl`, has reflection   |
| 9201 | **grpc-web** (HTTP/1.1) | what this app uses from the browser |

Two quirks discovered while building (both handled by the Vite proxy in dev,
and by the host's own transport in Electron/the extension):

1. **CORS allowlist** — port 9201 only answers CORS preflights for the dish's
   own origin, so a third-party web page cannot call it cross-origin.
2. **Referer guard** — requests carrying an unrecognized `Referer` header get
   an empty 200 back; the transport strips `Referer`/`Origin` before forwarding.

Protobuf schema is **not guessed**: `schema/dish.protoset` was dumped from the
dish's own gRPC reflection service and is decoded at runtime with
`@bufbuild/protobuf` (`core/dishClient.ts`). To refresh the schema after a
firmware update:

```bash
grpcurl -plaintext -protoset-out schema/dish.protoset \
  192.168.100.1:9200 describe SpaceX.API.Device.Device
cp schema/dish.protoset public/dish.protoset
```

The dish's history ring buffer (900 samples @ 1 Hz) is unrolled via its
absolute sample counter (`core/telemetry.ts`); note it reports `outages[]`
timestamps in the **GPS epoch** while `eventLog` uses Unix — the converter
accounts for the 18 leap seconds. See `LOCAL-API.md` for the full set of
measured behaviours, quirks, and dead-end fields on this firmware.

## Recorded history

The dish and router only hold a few minutes to a few hours locally. An
always-on **history recorder** (`collector/`, the "historian") polls
continuously and writes append-only local records so day/week/month views
have real data behind them — never anything invented across a gap; every
range reports what fraction of it was actually sampled. See
`collector/README.md` for how it runs and its on-disk format.

Everything above is local-only by design: your telemetry, your history, your
storage, never transmitted.

### Ghana monitor 1.4

Start in **Overview** for guided setup, today's recorded data and estimated spending. **Costs** supports calendar periods and your billing start day, explains plan allocation and electricity charges, and only compares periods with sufficient recording coverage. **Devices** lets you name and group devices locally. **Connection** keeps the detailed monitoring view, with the remaining tools under **Advanced**.

Optional budget notifications require both the Ghana budget toggle and the existing notification bell to be enabled. They use calendar-month targets, Ghana quiet hours, and recorded history rather than extra router polls. Export a backup in Overview before updating. See [release notes](docs/ghana-release-notes.md) for backup exclusions and update instructions. The ZIP contains PowerShell/macOS update helpers and each release publishes its SHA-256 checksum. Keep the same installation folder and extension ID when updating.
